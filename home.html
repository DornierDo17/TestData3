        <p>Software is a collection of instructions, data, or computer programs that are used to run machines and carry out particular activities. It is the antithesis of hardware, which refers to a computer’s external components.

In other words, the software is a computer program that provides a set of instructions to execute a user’s commands and tell the computer what to do.
